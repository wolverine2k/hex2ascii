Hex2ASCII (& vice-versa)
========================

Hex2ASCII is a small program written in QT that converts HEX to ASCII and vice-versa without any extra formatting requirements which is an advantage over other tools. QT lets it be cross compiled on various platforms as well.

Tested in Linux. Hopefully the windows version should simply compile. Using QT 4.
